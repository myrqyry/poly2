# üéÆ Poly2 - Retro Image Transformer

Transform your images with the distinct graphical style of classic, low-poly 3D video game consoles using Google's Gemini AI.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Image Upload**: Drag and drop or click to upload images (supports common formats)
- **Console Styles**: Choose from multiple retro console aesthetics:
  - PlayStation 1: Low-poly geometry with pixelated textures
  - Nintendo 64: Smooth shading with simple geometry
  - Sega Saturn: Flat shading with geometric shapes
  - Early 3D: Vertex wobble effects with limited colors
- **AI-Powered Transformation**: Leverages Google Gemini Vision API for intelligent style transfer
- **Demo Mode**: Built-in canvas filters for demonstration without API key
- **Download Results**: Save your transformed images as PNG files
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/myrqyry/poly2.git
   cd poly2
   ```

2. **Open in browser**:
   ```bash
   # Serve locally (recommended)
   python -m http.server 8000
   # or
   npx serve .
   
   # Then open http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Start transforming**:
   - Upload an image by dragging and dropping or clicking the upload area
   - Select your preferred retro console style
   - Click "Transform Image" to generate the retro version
   - Download your result!

## üîß Configuration

### Google Gemini API Setup (Optional)

For AI-enhanced transformations, configure the Gemini API:

**Important Note**: Gemini API provides image analysis and style descriptions rather than direct image generation. The app uses Gemini to analyze your image and provide intelligent insights for enhanced canvas-based transformations.

1. Get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/)
2. Update the `GEMINI_CONFIG` in `script.js`:
   ```javascript
   const GEMINI_CONFIG = {
       apiKey: 'your-api-key-here',
       model: 'gemini-pro-vision',
       imageGenerationUrl: 'https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro-vision:generateContent'
   };
   ```

**How it works**:
- Gemini analyzes your uploaded image
- Provides detailed style transformation instructions
- Enhanced canvas filters apply the transformation based on AI insights
- Fallback to demo mode if API is unavailable

For true AI image generation, consider integrating with:
- OpenAI DALL-E API
- Midjourney API
- Stability AI (Stable Diffusion)

### Demo Mode

Without an API key, the app uses sophisticated canvas-based filters that simulate retro graphics effects. This provides a fully functional demonstration of all features with impressive visual results.

## üé® Retro Styles

Each console style applies different visual transformations:

| Console | Effect Description |
|---------|------------------|
| **PlayStation 1** | Low-poly geometry, pixelated textures, limited color palette (32 colors per channel) |
| **Nintendo 64** | Smooth Gouraud shading, color banding, warmer tone shifts |
| **Sega Saturn** | Flat shading, geometric feel, very limited color palette, increased saturation |
| **Early 3D** | Vertex wobble simulation, heavy color reduction, random noise effects |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Image Processing**: Canvas API for client-side manipulation
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini Pro Vision API
- **File Handling**: FileReader API for uploads, Blob URLs for downloads
- **No Backend Required**: Fully client-side application
