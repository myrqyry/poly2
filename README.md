## üîß Configuration

### Google GenAI SDK Integration

The application now uses the official **Google GenAI JavaScript SDK** for true AI image generation and transformation:

**Key Features**:
- **Real AI Image Generation**: Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview model for actual image generation
- **Intelligent Transformation**: AI understands your image and applies retro console styles
- **Seamless Integration**: Official SDK with proper error handling and fallback
- **User-Friendly Setup**: Simple API key configuration with persistent storage

**Setup Instructions**:

1. Get your free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Open the application and enter your API key in the configuration section
3. Your key is securely stored locally for future use
4. Start transforming images with true AI power!

**How it works**:
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview**: Analyzes your image and generates retro-styled versions
- **Console-Specific Prompts**: Detailed prompts for each retro console style
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Sophisticated canvas filters when AI is unavailable
- **Mode Indicators**: Clear feedback on whether you're using AI or demo mode

**Supported Models**:
- `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` for image transformation
- Automatic fallback to enhanced canvas filters
